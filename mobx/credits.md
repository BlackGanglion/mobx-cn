## Credits {#credits}

MobX is inspired by reactive programming principles as found in spreadsheets. It is inspired by MVVM frameworks like in MeteorJS tracker, knockout and Vue.js. But MobX brings Transparent Functional Reactive Programming to the next level and provides a stand alone implementation. It implements TFRP in a glitch-free, synchronous, predictable and efficient manner.

A ton of credits for [Mendix](https://github.com/mendix), for providing the flexibility and support to maintain MobX and the chance to prove the philosophy of MobX in a real, complex, performance critical applications.

And finally kudos for all the people that believed in, tried, validated and even [sponsored](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/blob/master/sponsors.md) MobX.
